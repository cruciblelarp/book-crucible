# Currency and Equipment

A realm does not run itself on good intentions and the strength of its
warriors alone. The trade of goods and currency representative of goods
and services is a vital component of the functions of each of the Five
Realms, and indeed most races with any structure to their society.

Within the Five Realms there exist multiple currencies, from the major
currencies of the realm themselves (Sovereigns, Marks, Denarii and
Crux), to local currencies and those of distant realms. For the purposes
of the Chronicle, however it will be the aethershard currency commonly
used by the Dra’zhar that form the basis for the in-game economy.

* A **Lightshard (ls)** is the lowest denomination, and are formed from small
chips or cut crystals of poor quality clear or pale yellow aetherstone.
* A **Sunshard (ss)** is the common denomination for trading, and is
typically a well formed yellow crystal of useful aetherstone. 1 ss equals
10 ls.
* A **Moonshard (ms)** is a valuable denomination, a near flawless blue
aetherstone prized for arcane purposes. 1 ms equals 50 ss.
* A **Nobleshard (ns)** is a very rare denomination, a perfect purple
aetherstone crystal of inherent power and potential. 1 ns equals 20 ms.

Each character starts with 1000 Sunshards (ss) to buy their weapons,
armour, tools and other key pieces of starting equipment.

During the Chronicle, while it is encouraged that players buy and sell
food, trinkets and clothing, and pay those that help them or they are
feeling generous towards using their currency, the Gamemaster team
are not concerned with tracking whether a player has paid in-game for
every last piece of equipment they possess.

For those that wish to read it, the Crucible Codex provides a longer
list of equipment possibilities, but this is intended more for reference
purposes, as many of the items on the list will not have any practical
impact upon the game except for set dressing.
